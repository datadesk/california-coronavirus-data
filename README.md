#### [cdph-press-releases.csv](./cdph-press-releases.csv)

Totals published by the California Department of Public Health in [its daily press releases](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx). Each row contains all numbers included in that day's release.

This file includes cases and deaths, the age of victims, transmission types, tests and hospitalizations. The state has stopped supplying some fields and began supplying some others over time. Deprecated fields have been maintained in this file and are noted below.

Due to bureaucratic lags, the state's totals for cases and deaths arrive slower than The Times numbers, which are generated by surveying local agencies. The state's methods for collecting testing data have struggled with [errors](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-04/gavin-newsom-california-coronavirus-testing-task-force) and [delays](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-30/its-taking-up-to-eight-days-to-get-coronavirus-tests-results-heres-why).

Some dates are missing because the state did not publish a press release for that day.

#### [latimes-agency-totals.csv](./latimes-agency-totals.csv)

The total cases and deaths logged by local public health agencies each day. Each row contains the cumulative totals reported by a single agency as of that date. This file stopped updating in September 2021 when The Times switched its tracker to use case and death counts consolidated by the state's Department of Public Health. Those figures can be found elsewhere in this repository.

Most counties have only one agency except for Alameda and Los Angeles counties, where some cities run independent health departments. In Alameda County, the city of Berkeley is managed independently. In Los Angeles County, Pasadena and Long Beach are managed independently. These cities' totals are broken out into separate rows. In order to calculate county-level totals, you must aggregate them together using the `county` field.

#### [latimes-place-totals.csv](./latimes-place-totals.csv)

Most counties break out the location of cases within their service area. The Times is gathering and consolidating these lists. Each row contains cumulative case totals reported in that area as of that date. Some counties currently do not report cases by locality.

Different counties provide different geography types. Some provide data by region, some by Census designation, some by ZIP Code. The locations provided by Los Angeles County correspond to the public health department's official "Countywide Statistical Areas". Locations can be mapped after being joined to the shapes in `latimes-places-polygons.geojson` using the `id` column.

Be aware that some counties have shifted the place names used over time.

In some circumstances the true total of cases is obscured. Los Angeles and Orange counties decline to provide the precise number of cases in areas with low populations and instead provide a potential range. The lowest number in the range is entered into the record in the `confirmed_cases` field and an accompanying `note` includes the set of possible values.

#### [latimes-county-recovery-estimates.csv](./latimes-county-recovery-estimates.csv)

The estimated number of recovered and active cases by county each day.

The number is calculated by subtracting active case, deaths and currently hospitalized patients from the total case count. Active cases are estimated as the number of new cases over the last 14 days, which is based on the amount of time the CDC says most adults remain infectious with COVID-19. The Times consulted biostatisticians at UCLA and UCSF to develop the approach. Some health agencies use the same method.

The result matches closely in areas with officially reported counts. One limitation is that there may be some overlap among active and hospitilized cases, leading to an underestimate in the number of recovered patients.

#### [cdph-regional-stay-home-metrics.csv](./cdph-regional-stay-home-metrics.csv)

In December 2020, the state [introduced a new system](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/) for issuing stay home orders. The state's 58 counties were grouped into six regions and judged based on the percentage of available ICU beds. When the percentage available beds dropped below 15%, a stay home order restricting businesses and movement would be issued. 

This file records the metrics released for each region by day.

#### [cdph-nursing-home-county-totals.csv](./cdph-nursing-home-county-totals.csv)

The total number of cases and deaths in skilled-nursing facilities, residential care facilities for the elderly and adult residential facilities aggregated by county.

These numbers are calculated by The Times using the facilities lists above. The state chooses not to provide precise numbers at facilities with fewer than 10 cases. When totaling by county, The Times substitutes the minimum value of one. The result is that the tallies are likely an undercount and should be considered the minimum possible value.

#### [latimes-place-polygons.geojson](./latimes-place-polygons.geojson)

A map of sub-county areas where cases are tracked.

Different counties provide different geography types. Some provide data by region, some by Census designation, some by ZIP Code. The locations provided by Los Angeles County correspond to the public health department's official "Countywide Statistical Areas". Locations can be analyzed after being joined to the case counts in the `latimes-places-totals.csv` using the `id` column.

This file is a combination of dozens of different data files collected by Times reporters. Some shapes from county officials who maintain their own maps, others were scraped from county dashboards. In some cases, Census maps are used.

In some cases, the precise area being tracked by local officials is unclear. What you will find here is the best effort of Times reporters to represent what's been released. If you see any errors, please contact [ben.welsh@latimes.com](mailto:ben.welsh@latimes.com).
